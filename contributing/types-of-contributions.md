# Types of contributions :memo:

You can contribute to the OctoProfile Plus app in several ways. This repo is a place to discuss and collaborate on OctoProfile Plus! Our small, but mighty :muscle: team is maintaining this repo, to preserve our bandwidth, off topic conversations will be closed.

###  üì£ Discussions

Discussions are where we have conversations.

If you'd like help troubleshooting a docs PR you're working on, have a great new idea, or want to share something amazing you've learned in our docs, create an [Issue](https://github.com/wsameer/octoprofile-plus/issues) in the github with proper description.

  

### üêû Issues

[Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues) are used to track tasks that contributors can help with. If an issue has a triage label, we haven't reviewed it yet and you shouldn't begin work on it.

  

If you've found something in the app that should be updated, search open issues to see if someone else has reported the same thing. If it's something new, open an issue using a [template](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/new/choose). We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.
